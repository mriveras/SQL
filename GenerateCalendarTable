  DESCRIPTION: Procedure used to create a calendar table. Using the input parameters to define the scope of the data.

  NOTE: The name of the Calendar Table is defined in the code. Later will publish a dinamic one that obtains the name of the table from an input parameter.
  So far, just need to change the name to the name you desire. Current Name is fin.Calendar.
